# SpringBootOnWAS

This is an example of using SpringBoot on tWAS 855.  This excludes all the Boot parts of Spring and just uses Spring native.  This is due to that tWAS includes many of the features that SpringBoot includes and causes issues with classloading.  

To access the sample: http://host:port/hello/### . For example http://localhost:9080/hello/1 .
